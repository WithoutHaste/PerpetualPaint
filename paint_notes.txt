features
======================
Designed for black and white outline images, like a coloring book. Minor gray-scale supported.

1. Open bitmap/png image as bitmap. Display image on screen with zoom in/out options.

2. Program can identify different coloring sections, based on contiguous white/gray space
	a space is first identified by a y-by-y square of white pixels
	space expands outward in all directions until it is hemmed in by absolute black
	
3. Display color palette
	start with at least one default palette (maybe easter pastels)
	
4. Select color in palette, apply color to any part of the image
	click on absolute black is ignored (minor error noise)
	click on anything else will fill that section with the color
	white is replaced with true color
	grays are replaced with grayed-color
	
5. Re-color a colored section
	Result should be as if you had applied color over white
	
6. Build your own palette and save it

7. Swap colors in the image - like swap all color x sections with color y

8. Build a project of multiple images
	save a config file with all image locations so they can be opened as one project
	save a palette filename with the project
	see all images at once as thumbnails
	focus on one image to see it big
	color swaps can affect all images in the project at once
	
9. Save the resulting image(s)
